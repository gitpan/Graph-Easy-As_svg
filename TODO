Todo for Graph-Easy-As_svg
==========================

Output bugs:

* Node texts are moved wrongly on rotated nodes (their new
  center should rotate along with the shape)
* rotated node do not increase the graph size, so corners might get cut off
* implement border- and edge-style: wave
* _text_length() could be more accurate
* edges with style "double" have wrong corner pieces
* wide and broad self-loops are too small and the line must be moved
* multi-line text labels and text-labels on ver edges cross into the edge line
* support different edge starting point styles ala:

  ----->  |----->  o----->  +----->  *----->  >>----->

Shorter output:

* instead of rendering individual edge cells, we should create
  one path, this would allow better rendering of non-solid
  edges, like dashed or dotted ones
* put the stroke-width and stroke on the <g class="edge"> instead on
  each <line>

Browser-specific woes:

* Opera 8.5 does only support SVG Tiny :-( (no tspan etc)
* Opera 9.0 does only support SVG Basic :-( (no text-center)
* Firefox 1.5 gets tspan with 'x="..." dy="1em"' wrong
* Firefox 1.5 seems to ignore text-decoration on <text>
* Firefox 1.5 opens links inside the SVG object tag space
  (we work around that with an onclick-handler)
* Batik 1.5.1 has problems with 'font-size="12px"' on <text>
