=================

See Graph::Easy under LIMITATIONS for some hot topics.

In addition:

Output:

* support different edge starting point styles ala:

  ----->  |----->  o----->  +----->  *----->  >>----->

* implement border-style: double, wave and double-dash
* the size of a node does not only depend on the number of
  characters, but also on their size: "iii" is shorter than
  "WWW", unlike in ASCII
* instead of rendering individual edge cells, we should create
  one path, this would allow better rendering of non-solid
  edges, like dashed or dotted ones
* different parts of one edge are scattered around the output,
  these should be output one after one at the same time
* sorting output groups on class, and then combining them would
  shorten the output considerable
* support "\n" in labels/titles
* draw octagon/hexagon etc shapes
* support for background-colored group cells
* we could put the "stroke" and "stroke-width" on the <g class="edge" ...>,
  this would generate shorter code for edge pieces
