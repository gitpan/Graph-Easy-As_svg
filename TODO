Todo for Graph-Easy-As_svg
==========================

Output bugs:

* render the graph label (aka caption)
* support different edge starting point styles ala:

  ----->  |----->  o----->  +----->  *----->  >>----->

* implement border- and edge-style: wave
* the size of a node does not only depend on the number of
  characters, but also on their size: "iii" is shorter than
  "WWW", unlike in ASCII
* better support "\n" in labels/titles (line breaks are broken)
  (subsequent tspans need 'x="xxx"' on them)
* edges with style "double" have gaps
* crossing edge pieces are drawn incorrect

Shorter output:

* instead of rendering individual edge cells, we should create
  one path, this would allow better rendering of non-solid
  edges, like dashed or dotted ones
* different parts of one edge are scattered around the output,
  these should be output one after one at the same time
* sorting output groups on class, and then combining them would
  shorten the output considerable
* output all cell backgrounds first (to avoid overlap of content and also
  so that we can combine them to bigger rectangles if possible)
* we could put the "stroke" and "stroke-width" on the <g class="edge" ...>,
  this would generate shorter code for edge pieces
