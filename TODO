Todo for Graph-Easy-As_svg
==========================

Output bugs:

* Node texts are moved wrongly on rotated nodes (their new
  center should rotate along with the shape)
* rotated node do not increase the graph size, so corners might get cut off
* wide/broad/bold edges have an hole between the line and the open
  arrow, fill it with a triangle-shaped line-end
* support different edge starting point styles ala:

  ----->  |----->  o----->  +----->  *----->  >>----->

* implement border- and edge-style: wave
* _text_length() could be more accurate
* edges with style "double" have gaps on corner pieces
* multi-line text labels and text-labels on ver edges cross into the edge line
* implement arrow-style: none
* implement border drawing for Graph::Easy::Group::Cell

Shorter output:

* instead of rendering individual edge cells, we should create
  one path, this would allow better rendering of non-solid
  edges, like dashed or dotted ones
* different parts of one edge are scattered around the output,
  these should be output one after one at the same time
* sorting output groups on class, and then combining them would
  shorten the output considerable
* output all cell backgrounds first (to avoid overlap of content and also
  so that we can combine them to bigger rectangles if possible)

Browser-specific woes:

* Opera 8.5 does only support SVG Tiny :-( (no tspan etc)
* Opera 9.0 does only support SVG Basic :-( (no text-center)
* Firefox 1.5 gets tspan with 'x="..." dy="1em"' wrong
* Firefox 1.5 seems to ignore text-decoration on <text>
* Firefox 1.5 opens links inside the SVG object tag space
  (we work around that with an onclick-handler)
* Batik 1.5.1 has problems with 'font-size="12px"' on <text>
